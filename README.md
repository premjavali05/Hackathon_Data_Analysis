# My Zomato Data Hackathon Journey with Innomatics Research Labs: A Deep Dive into Data & Dining 🍽️📊

Just wrapped up an incredible experience at the Zomato Data Hackathon organized by **Innomatics Research Labs**, and I’m thrilled to share what I learned and how it felt to dive into this data-driven adventure! 🚀

### The Challenge

The goal was to analyze a rich dataset of restaurants from Zomato, uncovering insights to optimize operations, boost profitability, and enhance customer satisfaction in Bangalore’s vibrant food scene. From exploring restaurant ratings to estimating revenue potential, every question pushed me to think critically and creatively.

### Key Learnings

- **Data Cleaning is an Art**: Transforming messy data—like handling "NEW" ratings or standardizing cuisine lists—was a puzzle that taught me patience and precision. Converting ratings from "4.1/5" to clean floats felt like solving a mini-mystery! 🕵️‍♂️
- **Pandas Power**: Using Pandas to slice, group, and aggregate data was a game-changer. I loved crafting queries to find the most diverse dining areas (shoutout to BTM with 62 restaurant types!) or pinpointing high-potential investment zones like MG Road.
- **Insights Drive Impact**: Discovering that Quick Bites & Food Courts had the lowest ratings (3.3/5) highlighted areas for Zomato to improve customer experience. On the flip side, areas like Koramangala 7th Block shone as revenue goldmines due to high ratings, votes, and costs.

### The Experience

This wasn’t just about coding—it was about storytelling with data. Each insight felt like uncovering a hidden gem about how people dine and what makes a restaurant thrive in Bangalore. The thrill of seeing my code reveal that restaurants serving both North Indian and Chinese cuisines average a 3.59 rating was unmatched! 😄

The hackathon, hosted by Innomatics Research Labs, reminded me why I love data science: it’s a blend of curiosity, problem-solving, and real-world impact. 

### Takeaways

- **Stay Curious**: Every dataset has a story waiting to be told.
- **Data Shapes Decisions**: From reducing complaints to identifying profitable areas, data is the backbone of smart strategies.

A huge thanks to **Innomatics Research Labs** for organizing this amazing event and to my team for making it such a rewarding experience! I’m more inspired than ever to keep exploring the world of data science. 🌟
